# Install Python 3.8 on Jetson Nano

To install Python 3.8, follow these steps:

### 1. Install Required Dependencies

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade
sudo apt install build-essential libssl-dev zlib1g-dev libncurses5-dev libncursesw5-dev libreadline-dev libsqlite3-dev libgdbm-dev libdb5.3-dev libbz2-dev libexpat1-dev liblzma-dev libffi-dev libc6-dev
```

### 2. Download and Compile Python 3.8

```bash
wget https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.8.12/Python-3.8.12.tar.xz
```

Extract and build:

```bash
tar -xf Python-3.8.12.tar.xz
cd Python-3.8.12
./configure --enable-optimizations
make -j4
sudo make altinstall
python3.8 --version
```

### 3. Create a Virtual Environment

```bash
python3.8 -m venv myenv
source myenv/bin/activate
```

### 4. Install Ultralytics and Convert Model to TensorRT Engine

```bash
pip3 install ultralytics
/usr/src/tensorrt/bin/trtexec --onnx=yolov8n.onnx --saveEngine=yolov8n.engine --fp16
```

### 5. Link TensorRT Engine to Python 3.8 Virtual Environment

```bash
source myenv/bin/activate
```

**Note:** Running `.pt` models directly on Python 3.8 works but is not optimized.

# Install Jetson Nano CUDA and OpenCV

To install CUDA and OpenCV for Jetson Nano, follow these steps:

### 1. Install OpenCV 4.5.0 with JetPack 4

OpenCV is required for image processing and deep learning applications.

- [Installation script for OpenCV 4.5.0 with JetPack 4](https://github.com/AastaNV/JEP/blob/master/script/install_opencv4.5.0_Jetpack4.sh)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AastaNV/JEP.git && cd JEP/script && ./install_opencv4.5.0_Jetpack4.sh
```

### 2. Enable Swapfile for Better Performance

This increases virtual memory, helping Jetson Nano run heavy workloads.

- [Swapfile installation guide](https://github.com/JetsonHacksNano/installSwapfile)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/JetsonHacksNano/installSwapfile.git
cd installSwapfile
./installSwapfile.sh
```

### 3. Build OpenCV 4.5.1 Manually

For customized OpenCV versions with additional optimizations.

- [Custom OpenCV build script](https://github.com/JetsonHacksNano/buildOpenCV)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/JetsonHacksNano/buildOpenCV.git
cd buildOpenCV
gedit buildOpenCV.sh  # Edit OPENCV_VERSION=4.5.1

./buildOpenCV.sh |& tee openCV_build.log
```

*The installation process will take approximately 2 hours.*

# Helol AI World

Helol AI World is a project using NVIDIA Jetson to implement an object detection model based on SSD-Mobilenet. This project includes steps from setting up the environment, collecting data, training the model, exporting ONNX files, and performing object detection.

## 1. Clone Repository

```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/dusty-nv/jetson-inference.git
```

## 2. Installation

```bash
cd jetson-inference
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make -j$(nproc)
sudo make install
```

## 3. Documentation

- [Installation and usage guide](https://github.com/dusty-nv/jetson-inference)
- [SSD training with PyTorch](https://github.com/dusty-nv/jetson-inference/blob/master/docs/pytorch-ssd.md)

## Conclusion

After completing the above steps, you will have an SSD-Mobilenet model trained on customized data and capable of running on a Jetson device for real-time object detection.

Good luck! ðŸš€
